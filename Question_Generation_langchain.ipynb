Transformer-based large language models have com-\\npletely changed the ﬁeld of speech and language processing. Indeed, every subse-\\nquent chapter in this textbook will make use of them. We’ll focus for now on left-\\nto-right (sometimes called causal or autoregressive) language modeling, in which\\nwe are given a sequence of input tokens and predict output tokens one by one by\\nconditioning on the prior context.\\nThe transformer is a neural network with a speciﬁc structure that includes a\\nmechanism called self-attention ormulti-head attention .1Attention can be thought\\nof as a way to build contextual representations of a token’s meaning by attending to\\nand integrating information from surrounding tokens, helping the model learn how\\ntokens relate to each other over large spans.\\nStackedTransformerBlocksSolongandthanksforlongandthanksforNext tokenall……\\n…\\nU\\nInput tokensx1x2LanguageModelingHead\\nx3x4x5InputEncoding\\nE1+\\nE2+\\nE3+\\nE4+\\nE5+……………\\nU\\nU\\nU\\nU…logitslogitslogitslogitslogits\\nFigure 9.1 The architecture of a (left-to-right) transformer, showing how each input token\\nget encoded, passed through a set of stacked transformer blocks, and then a language model\\nhead that predicts the next token.\\nFig. 9.1 sketches the transformer architecture.

The set of nblocks maps an entire context window\\nof input vectors (x1,...,xn)to a window of output vectors (h1,...,hn)of the same\\nlength. A column might contain from 12 to 96 or more stacked blocks.\\nThe column of blocks is preceded by the input encoding component, which pro-\\ncesses an input token (like the word thanks ) into a contextual vector representation,\\nusing an embedding matrix Eand a mechanism for encoding token position. Each\\ncolumn is followed by a language modeling head , which takes the embedding out-\\nput by the ﬁnal transformer block, passes it through an unembedding matrix Uand\\na softmax over the vocabulary to generate a single token for that column.\\nTransformer-based language models are complex, and so the details will unfold\\nover the next 5 chapters. In the next sections we’ll introduce multi-head attention,\\nthe rest of the transformer block, and the input encoding and language modeling\\nhead components. Chapter 10 discusses how language models are pretrained , and\\nhow tokens are generated via sampling . Chapter 11 introduces masked language\\nmodeling and the BERT family of bidirectional transformer encoder models. Chap-\\nter 12 shows how to prompt LLMs to perform NLP tasks by giving instructions and\\ndemonstrations, and how to align the model with human preferences. Chapter 13\\nwill introduce machine translation with the encoder-decoder architecture.\\n9.1 Attention\\nRecall from Chapter 6 that for word2vec and other static embeddings, the repre-\\nsentation of a word’s meaning is always the same vector irrespective of the context:\\nthe word chicken , for example, is always represented by the same ﬁxed vector. So\\na static vector for the word itmight somehow encode that this is a pronoun used\\nfor animals and inanimate entities. But in context ithas a much richer meaning.\\nConsider itin one of these two sentences:\\n(9.1) The chicken didn’t cross the road because itwas too tired.\\n(9.2) The chicken didn’t cross the road because itwas too wide.\\nIn (9.1) itis the chicken (i.e., the reader knows that the chicken was tired), while\\nin (9.2) itis the road (and the reader knows that the road was wide).2That is, if\\nwe are to compute the meaning of this sentence, we’ll need the meaning of itto be\\nassociated with the chicken in the ﬁrst sentence and associated with the road in\\nthe second one, sensitive to the context.\\nFurthermore, consider reading left to right like a causal language model, pro-\\ncessing the sentence up to the word it:\\n(9.3) The chicken didn’t cross the road because it\\nAt this point we don’t yet know which thing itis going to end up referring to! So a\\nrepresentation of itat this point might have aspects of both chicken androad as\\nthe reader is trying to guess what happens next.\\nThis fact that words have rich linguistic relationships with other words that may\\nbe far away pervades language. Consider two more examples:\\n(9.4) The keys to the cabinet areon the table.\\n(9.5) I walked along the pond , and noticed one of the trees along the bank .\\n2We say that in the ﬁrst example itcorefers with the chicken, and in the second itcorefers with the\\nroad; we’ll return to this in Chapter 23.'),\n",

In (9.5), we know that bank refers\\nto the side of a pond or river and not a ﬁnancial institution because of the context,\\nincluding words like pond . (We’ll discuss word senses more in Chapter 11.)\\nThe point of all these examples is that these contextual words that help us com-\\npute the meaning of words in context can be quite far away in the sentence or para-\\ngraph. Transformers can build contextual representations of word meaning, contex-\\ntual embeddings , by integrating the meaning of these helpful contextual words. In acontextual\\nembeddings\\ntransformer, layer by layer, we build up richer and richer contextualized representa-\\ntions of the meanings of input tokens.

Attention takes an\\ninput representation xicorresponding to the input token at position i, and a context\\nwindow of prior inputs x1..xi−1, and produces an output ai.\\nIn causal, left-to-right language models, the context is any of the prior words.\\nThat is, when processing xi, the model has access to xias well as the representations\\nof all the prior tokens in the context window (context windows consist of thousands\\nof tokens) but no tokens after i. (By contrast, in Chapter 11 we’ll generalize attention\\nso it can also look ahead to future words.)\\nFig. 9.3 illustrates this ﬂow of information in an entire causal self-attention layer,\\nin which this same attention computation happens in parallel at each token position\\ni. Thus a self-attention layer maps input sequences (x1,...,xn)to output sequences\\nof the same length (a1,...,an).\\nattentionattentionSelf-AttentionLayerattentionattentionattentiona1a2a3a4a5x3x4x5x1x2\\nFigure 9.3 Information ﬂow in causal self-attention. When processing each input xi, the\\nmodel attends to all the inputs up to, and including xi.\\nSimpliﬁed version of attention At its heart, attention is really just a weighted\\nsum of context vectors, with a lot of complications added to how the weights are\\ncomputed and what gets summed. For pedagogical purposes let’s ﬁrst describe a\\nsimpliﬁed intuition of attention, in which the attention output aiat token position i\\nis simply the weighted sum of all the representations xj, for all j≤i; we’ll use αi j\\nto mean how much xishould contribute to aj:\\nSimpliﬁed version: ai=∑\\nj≤iαi jxj (9.6)\\nEach αi jis a scalar used for weighing the value of input xjwhen summing up\\nthe inputs to compute ai. How shall we compute this αweighting? In attention we\\nweight each prior embedding proportionally to how similar it is to the current token\\ni. So the output of attention is a sum of the embeddings of prior tokens weighted\\nby their similarity with the current token embedding. We compute similarity scores\\nviadot product , which maps two vectors into a scalar value ranging from −∞to\\n∞. The larger the score, the more similar the vectors that are being compared. We’ll\\nnormalize these scores with a softmax to create the vector of weights αi j,j≤i.\\nSimpliﬁed Version: score(xi,xj) = xi·xj (9.7)\\nαi j=softmax (score(xi,xj))∀j≤i(9.8)\\nThus in Fig. 9.3 we compute a3by computing three scores: x3·x1,x3·x2andx3·x3,\\nnormalizing them by a softmax, and using the resulting probabilities as weights\\nindicating each of their proportional relevance to the current position i. Of course,'),\n",

But other context words may also be similar to i, and\\nthe softmax will also assign some weight to those words. Then we use these weights\\nas the αvalues in Eq. 9.6 to compute the weighted sum that is our a3.\\nThe simpliﬁed attention in equations 9.6 – 9.8 demonstrates the attention-based\\napproach to computing ai: compare the xito prior vectors, normalize those scores\\ninto a probability distribution used to weight the sum of the prior vector. But now\\nwe’re ready to remove the simpliﬁcations.\\nA single attention head using query, key, and value matrices Now that we’ve\\nseen a simple intuition of attention, let’s introduce the actual attention head , the attention head\\nversion of attention that’s used in transformers. (The word head is often used in head\\ntransformers to refer to speciﬁc structured layers). The attention head allows us to\\ndistinctly represent three different roles that each input embedding plays during the\\ncourse of the attention process:\\n• As the current element being compared to the preceding inputs. We’ll refer to\\nthis role as a query . query\\n• In its role as a preceding input that is being compared to the current element\\nto determine a similarity weight. We’ll refer to this role as a key. key\\n• And ﬁnally, as a value of a preceding element that gets weighted and summed value\\nup to compute the output for the current element.\\nTo capture these three different roles, transformers introduce weight matrices\\nWQ,WK, and WV. These weights will project each input vector xiinto a represen-\\ntation of its role as a key, query, or value:\\nqi=xiWQ;ki=xiWK;vi=xiWV(9.9)\\nGiven these projections, when we are computing the similarity of the current ele-\\nment xiwith some prior element xj, we’ll use the dot product between the current\\nelement’s query vector qiand the preceding element’s keyvector kj. Furthermore,\\nthe result of a dot product can be an arbitrarily large (positive or negative) value, and\\nexponentiating large values can lead to numerical issues and loss of gradients during\\ntraining. To avoid this, we scale the dot product by a factor related to the size of the\\nembeddings, via diving by the square root of the dimensionality of the query and\\nkey vectors ( dk). We thus replace the simpliﬁed Eq. 9.7 with Eq. 9.11. The ensuing\\nsoftmax calculation resulting in αi jremains the same, but the output calculation for\\naiis now based on a weighted sum over the value vectors v(Eq. 9.13).\\nHere’s a ﬁnal set of equations for computing self-attention for a single self-\\nattention output vector aifrom a single input vector xi. This version of attention\\ncomputes aiby summing the values of the prior elements, each weighted by the\\nsimilarity of its keyto the query from the current element:\\nqi=xiWQ;kj=xjWK;vj=xjWV(9.10)\\nscore(xi,xj) =qi·kj√dk(9.11)\\nαi j=softmax (score(xi,xj))∀j≤i (9.12)\\nai=∑\\nj≤iαi jvj (9.13)\\nWe illustrate this in Fig. 9.4 for the case of calculating the value of the third output\\na3in a sequence.'),\n",

But\\nactually, transformers use multiple attention heads. The intuition is that each head\\nmight be attending to the context for different purposes: heads might be special-\\nized to represent different linguistic relationships between context elements and the\\ncurrent token, or to look for particular kinds of patterns in the context.\\nSo in multi-head attention we have hseparate attention heads that reside inmulti-head\\nattention\\nparallel layers at the same depth in a model, each with its own set of parameters that\\nallows the head to model different aspects of the relationships among inputs. Thus\\neach head iin a self-attention layer has its own set of key, query and value matrices:\\nWKi,WQiandWVi. These are used to project the inputs into separate key, value,\\nand query embeddings for each head.\\nWhen using multiple heads the model dimension dis still used for the input\\nand output, the key and query embeddings have dimensionality dk, and the value\\nembeddings are of dimensionality dv(again, in the original transformer paper dk=\\ndv=64,h=8, and d=512).

A multi-head attention computation takes an input\\nvector xiand maps it to an output aiby adding in vectors from prior tokens,\\nweighted by how relevant they are for the processing of the current word.\\n• Atransformer block consists of a residual stream in which the input from\\nthe prior layer is passed up to the next layer, with the output of different com-\\nponents added to it. These components include a multi-head attention layer\\nfollowed by a feedforward layer , each preceded by layer normalizations .\\nTransformer blocks are stacked to make deeper and more powerful networks.\\n• The input to a transformer is a computing by adding an embedding (computed\\nwith an embedding matrix ) to a positional encoding that represents the se-\\nquential position of the token in the window.\\n• Language models can be built out of stacks of transformer blocks, with a\\nlanguage model head at the top, which applies an unembedding matrix to\\nthe output Hof the top layer to generate the logits , which are then passed\\nthrough a softmax to generate word probabilities.\\n• Transformer-based language models have a wide context window (as wide\\nas 32768 tokens for very large models) allowing them to draw on enormous\\namounts of context to predict upcoming words.\\nBibliographical and Historical Notes\\nThe transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) was developed drawing on two lines of prior\\nresearch: self-attention andmemory networks .\\nEncoder-decoder attention, the idea of using a soft weighting over the encodings\\nof input words to inform a generative decoder (see Chapter 13) was developed by\\nGraves (2013) in the context of handwriting generation, and Bahdanau et al.

This idea was extended to self-attention by dropping the need for separate\\nencoding and decoding sequences and instead seeing attention as a way of weighting\\nthe tokens in collecting information passed from lower layers to higher layers (Ling\\net al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016).\\nOther aspects of the transformer, including the terminology of key, query, and\\nvalue, came from memory networks , a mechanism for adding an external read-'),\n",
